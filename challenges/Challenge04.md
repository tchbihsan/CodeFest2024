*01:* AWS Web Application Architecture Challenge

*Problem Statement:*

Your company aims to develop a scalable and resilient web application to provide a platform for users to collaborate on projects in real-time. The application should be capable of handling a growing user base while maintaining high availability and performance. As a cloud architect, your task is to design and implement the architecture for this web application using AWS services, ensuring security, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

*Requirements:*

1. *Scalability:* Design an architecture that can handle varying levels of user traffic without compromising performance. The solution should be able to scale both vertically and horizontally based on demand.

2. *High Availability:* Ensure the web application is highly available to users. Design for fault tolerance and implement mechanisms to minimize downtime in the event of failures.

3. *Security:* Implement robust security measures to protect the web application and user data. Utilize AWS security services and best practices to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential security threats.

4. *Cost Optimization:* Design the architecture with cost optimization in mind. Utilize AWS services efficiently to minimize infrastructure costs while meeting performance and scalability requirements.

5. *Data Management:* Implement a data management strategy that ensures data consistency, durability, and scalability. Choose appropriate AWS database services and caching mechanisms to store and retrieve data efficiently.

6. *Monitoring and Logging:* Set up monitoring and logging solutions to track the performance and health of the web application. Utilize AWS monitoring services to gather insights into application behavior and detect potential issues proactively.

7. *Deployment Automation:* Implement automated deployment pipelines to streamline the deployment process and ensure consistency across environments. Utilize AWS DevOps services to automate the build, test, and deployment phases.

8. *Compliance and Governance:* Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements. Implement governance policies and access controls to maintain security and compliance posture.

*Deliverables:*

- Architectural diagram detailing the components and their interactions.
- Description of each component and its purpose in the architecture.
- Explanation of how the architecture meets each requirement.

*Evaluation Criteria:*

- Adherence to AWS best practices and architectural principles.
- Scalability and performance of the proposed architecture.
- Resilience and fault tolerance measures implemented.
- Security measures and compliance with security best practices.
- Cost-effectiveness of the solution.
- Clarity and completeness of documentation.
