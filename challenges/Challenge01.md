# Challenge 1: Deploy your first AWS resources via Terraform

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge &gt;](./Challenge-02.md)

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will create a S3 bucket and a single NoSQL database using S3 and DynamoDB to create AWS resources that will be used in the upcoming challenges. 
  - Amazon S3 is an object storage service that is widely used for storing images, videos, files, hosting static website and many more features!
  - DynamoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data and suitable for applications that require low-latency access to large datasets like mobile apps, gaming, IoT and real time analytics. 

## Key Concepts

- **Object storage service â€“** A service that manages data as object where each object contains data, metadata and a unique identifier.
- **NoSQL database -** A database system that differs from the traditional relational database and designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data with more flexibility in data modeling. 

## Description

* Using Terraform, you need to deploy 1 S3 bucket and 1 DynamoDB in the **us-east-2** region.

## Success Criteria

1. You have successfully created a S3 bucket and attached a bucket policy to control access to your resources via Terraform.
2. You have successfully created 1 DynamoDB and added some test data in you database via Terraform.
